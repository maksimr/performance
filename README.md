**TL;DR**
- 🔵 HTML markup is transformed into a Document Object Model (DOM)
- 🍆 CSS markup is transformed into a CSS Object Model (CSSOM).
- 🍆 The DOM and CSSOM trees are combined to form the *Render Tree*.
- 🍆 Layout computes the exact position and size of each object.
- 🍏 The last step is paint, which takes in the final render tree and renders the pixels to the screen.


## Document Object Model (DOM)

## CSS Object Model (CSSOM)
By default, CSS is treated as a render blocking resource, which means that the browser won't render any processed content until the CSSOM is constructed

## Render-tree (Reflow)
Render tree contains only the nodes required to render the page.

Up to this point we've calculated which nodes should be visible and their computed styles, but we have not calculated their exact position and size within the viewport of the device---that's the **layout** stage, also known as **reflow**.

The output of the layout process is a **box model**, which precisely captures the exact position and size of each element within the viewport: *all of the relative measurements are converted to absolute pixels on the screen*.

- 🔵 **Parse HTML** - HTML markup is transformed into a Document Object Model (*DOM*)
- 🍆 **Recalculate Style** - CSS markup is transformed into a CSS Object Model (*CSSOM*)
- 🍆 **Layout** - *Render tree* construction, position, and size calculation
- 🍏 **Paint** - Convert the render tree to pixels on the screen.

## CSS Performance

[will-change](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/will-change) - The will-change CSS property provides a way for authors to hint browsers about the kind of changes to be expected on an element, so that the browser can set up appropriate optimizations ahead of time before the element is actually changed. These kind of optimizations can increase the responsiveness of a page by doing potentially expensive work ahead of time before they are actually required

[contain](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/contain) - The contain property allows an author to indicate that an element and its contents are, as much as possible, independent of the rest of the document tree. This allows the browser to recalculate layout, style, paint, size, or any combination of them for a limited area of the DOM and not the entire page. This property is useful on pages that contain a lot of widgets that are all independent as it can be used to prevent one widget's CSS rules from changing other things on the page.

[pointer-events: none](https://www.thecssninja.com/css/pointer-events-60fps) -  Allow avoiding unnecessary paints through disabling hover effects as the user scrolls
